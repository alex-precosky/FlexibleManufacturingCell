Contained in here is our completed implementation for EECE494 assignment 6.

For some concluding remarks on the implementation, see the HTML documentation.

About directory layout:
-----------------------

There are two main directories: doc, and src.  The HTML documentation
is in doc, and all of the source code is in src.  Inside src, there
are three main subdirectories: FlexInterfaceC, FlexibleCell, and
ControlSystem.  FlexInterfaceC holds the source to the library
that provides the interface to the java simulator.  The java simulator's
source is in FlexibleCell.   Our own software, the control system,
is in directory ControlSystem.

In summary, the major directories are:

doc
src
src/FlexibleCell
src/FlexInterfaceC
src/ControlSystem


To build project:
-----------------

cd into the src directory, and run ./configure, then make
The java simulator, flexInterface library, and our control system will all
be built.

To execute:
-----------

cd into src/ControlSystem directory, and run ./start
The simulator will be started along with our control system.  The
script will set any needed environment variables. Load
some blanks and watch it go!

To view documentation:
----------------------

Documentation is in HTML format, and begins with doc/index.html
