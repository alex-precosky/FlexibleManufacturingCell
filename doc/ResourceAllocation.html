Processing Units

Before a blank coming off the feed belt requests to be picked up by the
crane, it informs the processing units of the units in which it needs to
be processed.  These units are then reserved for this blank, and the
blank will not be picked up until any blanks in the system that use
these units have been placed on the deposit belt.  When the blank is
placed on the deposit belt, it signals that it is done with the system.
