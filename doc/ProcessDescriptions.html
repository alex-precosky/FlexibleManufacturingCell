This file specifies the various threads of execution of the control
system.&nbsp; These are all specified in the <a
 href="UseCaseModel.html">use case</a> models, except for the main
thread, which is responsible for startup of the control system.&nbsp;
The C source file which contains the code for each of these threads is
specified.<br>
<br>
&lt;main.c&gt;<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Main Thread<a name="Main"></a></span><br>
<br>
<br>
The main thread of execution is what runs when the system starts
up.&nbsp; It will set up the signal handler for SIGALRM signals that
are emitted when a blank triggers the feed belt sensor.&nbsp; Then, it
will create all of the sync objects that the system needs, as shown in
the pipeline diagrams with the use cases.&nbsp; Finally, it will start
the threads corresponding to the active classes shown in the pipeline
diagrams.&nbsp; These threads will be implemented as POSIX
threads.&nbsp; At this point, the system will be ready to process
blanks arriving on the feed belt.<br>
<br>
&lt;FeedbeltArrivalThd.c&gt;<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">FeedBeltArrivalHandlerThread<a
 name="feedbeltarrival"></a></span><br>
<br>
This thread was specified in use-case U1.&nbsp; This thread is
triggered to run when the semaphore newItem has been signalled.&nbsp;
The thread will then stop the feed belt immediately, then request a
barcode read.&nbsp; With the barcode information read, it will
instantiate a new <span style="font-style: italic;">blank</span>
object with the information stored on the blank.&nbsp; Next, the
processing units are reserved, as specified in the resource allocation
section of the <a href="SupplementarySpecification.html">supplementary
specification</a>.&nbsp; Next, a crane is requested, which picks up the
blank.&nbsp; With the blank off the feed belt, the belt is started
again.&nbsp; The blank object, as well as the number of the crane that
holds the blank (should always be the number of the leftmost crane,
since only this crane can reach the feed belt), are placed into a
buffer of blanks that are held by a crane that need moving to a
processing unit.<br>
<br>
&lt;BlankToUnitThd.c&gt;<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">TakeBlankToUnitThread<a
 name="taketounit"></a></span><br>
<br>
This thread was specified in use-case U2.&nbsp; Blank objects are
retrived from the buffer of blanks that are held by a crane and need to
be moved to a processing unit.&nbsp; The buffer also stores the number
of the crane that holds each blank.&nbsp; Two of these threads operate
in paralell, since up to two blanks could possibly be moved in this
fashion at a time.&nbsp; The crane is moved to its destination, and the
blank is placed into the processing unit.&nbsp; The blank object is
placed in a buffer of blanks that have been placed in a processing
unit, and await processing.&nbsp; The crane is signalled that we are
done with it for now.<br>
<br>
&lt;ProcessingUnitThd.h&gt;<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">ProcessingUnitThread<a name="process"></a></span><br>
<br>
This thread was specified in use-case U3.&nbsp; Blank objects are
retreived from a buffer of blanks that have been placed in a processing
unit, and await processing.&nbsp; The processing unit that the blank is
in&nbsp; is switched on, and then the thread sleeps for the minimum
processing time.&nbsp; A crane is then reserved, which comes and picks
up the blank.&nbsp; Then, depending on whether the blank needs to go to
another unit, or the deposit belt, its object is placed in either a
buffer of blanks that are held by a crane and need to go to another
unit, or a buffer of blanks that are held by a crane and need to go do
the deposit belt.<br>
<br>
&lt;BlankToDepositThd.c&gt;<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">TakeBlankToDepositBeltThread<a
 name="taketodepositbelt"></a><br>
</span><br>
This thread was specified in use-case U4.&nbsp; This thread retreives
blanks from a buffer of blanks that are held by a crane and need to go
do the deposit belt.&nbsp; Once it is assured that the start of the
deposit belt is free of obstruction, the crane is moved to the deposit
belt, and the blank is placed on the belt.&nbsp; Then, the crane
controller is notified that we are finished with&nbsp; the crane for
now.<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;SensorPollThread.c&gt;<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">SensorPollThread<a
 name="SensorPollThread"></a></span><br>
<br>
This thread keeps the SensorData object up to date with the latest
sensor information by pollling the sensors at regular intervals.<br>
