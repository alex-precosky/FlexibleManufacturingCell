<h2>Implementation Notes/ Closing Remarks</h2>
<br>
<br>
By following the design we had made, we were able to implement the
system.&nbsp; Very few design changes were needed; our implementation
was almost a formal tranlation of our design.&nbsp; The system mostly
works as advertised.<br>
<br>
One first note is that the system assumes a numbering scheme of
processing units.&nbsp; The top left unit is called unit '1', the top
right unit is '2', the bottom left unit is '3', and the bottom right
unit is '4'.&nbsp; So test blanks should have their barcodes set up so
that they need to visit units of one of these numbers.&nbsp; Undefined
behaviour will occur if a blank shows up wanting to use processing unit
'0' or '5' or '92', etc.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Next, a note on throughput.&nbsp; Our original design was not completly
optimal in maximizing blank throughput.&nbsp; The symantics boggled our
minds when trying to just think about it in non-programming English
descriptions, so coming up with fully optimized C algorithms just
wasn't in the cards for us.&nbsp; There are a few simplifications we
made.&nbsp; One such simplification this is we require that all of the
units a blank will need to use are reserved before we let that blank
into the system.&nbsp; So if one blank is in the system that is using
units 1 and 4, and another one arrives at the feed belt that wants to
use units 1 and 2, the new blank will not be admitted until the first
blank has left the system and unreserved its processing units.&nbsp;
Another simplification that limits our blank throughput is that crane
assignment is pre-determined based upon where a blank is located and
where it needs to move, rather than assigning the closest available
crane, or some other similar way.&nbsp; For example, moving between
units '1' and '3' always uses crane 1.<br>
<br>
Our system does not use the maxTime parameter or 'order' flag when
processing blanks.&nbsp; Blanks are always processed for at least
'minTime', and in the order specified in the blank.<br>
<br>
The only bug in the system we noticied is sometimes blanks are taken
out of their units before their time is up.&nbsp; In order to make sure
a blank was processed for the right amount of time, we used flexWait(),
which calls nanosleep() to wait for the desired amount of time.&nbsp;
But, of course, these functions are linked to real-world time rather
than simulated time, so of course the desired time will not always be
waited.&nbsp; To get correct waiting times, we should have found a way
to gain access to the simulated time clock.&nbsp; Other than this, the
blanks we tested worked without error.<br>
