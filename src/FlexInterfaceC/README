This directory contains a simple C interface library to the flexible Cell 
simulator.

You can make the library using:

make clean
make all


This will create the library (libflexLibrary.so) as well as a test controller
called testControl.  You can run the simulation and controller using the
command: start.

You must have the following for the test to work:

LD_LIBRARY_PATH set to point to the directory containing libflexLibrary.so 
CLASSPATH set to point to the directory containing flexible cell simulation 


The test controller sets up some threads, turns on the feed belt and
 then moves the crane to a new position.  If an item is placed on the
feedbelt it will advance until it triggers the feedbelt sensor.  The
testController will stop the feedbelt and get the bar code.  While
all this is happening there is also a periodic task that is polling
the sensors every 2 update periods.  Try adding an item to see what
happens.
